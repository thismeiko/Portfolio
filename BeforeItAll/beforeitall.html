            <p>We should strive to inhibit any preconceptions when critically analyzing our world. The metrics that we draw are ultimately limited by our perspective as humans. What are their interests for plants? Nowadays, there are many slogans that are to protect the environment, for plants, animals, etc.I hope critically examine how certain advocations and messages may have different interests in their mind.

            <p class="green">What are interests for plants?</p>
            <p>Plants are an essential part of our lives, providing us with food, medicine, and oxygen. However, our relationship with plants is often one of exploitation. The work explores how we can cultivate a more respectful and reciprocal relationship with plants, acknowledging their intrinsic value beyond their usefulness to humans.
                We examine how our desire to grow plants faster and larger has led to the use of harmful chemicals and other human's actions, which have unintended consequences for the environment and human health. We encourage viewers to question what we mean by "harmful" and to consider whose interests are served by our care of plants.
