        <p>In recent years, the topic of fashion and environmental protection has attracted much
            attention. Many environmentalists and animal protection enthusiasts have resisted the
            extravagance, waste and killing of animals in the fashion industry through demonstrations.
            At the same time, the fashion industry has gradually noticed this problem and
            tried to reduce pollution and waste in its own way. This is my inspiration for creating
            this website. The purpose of this website is to encourage people to buy second-hand
            goods to reduce pollution, rebuild and use waste and old things; at the same time, it
            also provides vintage clothing fans a platform to exchange and share stories between
            them and their clothes.</p>
